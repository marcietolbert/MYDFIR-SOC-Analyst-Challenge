# MYDIFR SOC Analyst Challenge

## Overview

The MYDIFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, created by Steven of the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MyDFIR">MyDFIR</a> is a 30-day challenge aimed at helping aspiring SOC Analysts gain real-world practical experience through the setup and configuration of a realistic SOC enviroment. This challenge not only tasks the SOC Analyst with the creation of a cloud-based lab enviroment using VLTUR, but also tasks the analyst with mimicking real-world attack scenarios for detection and investigation. The goal of this writeup is to showcase how the pracital knowledge and experience I've obtained over the course of this challenge was applied within a simulated SOC enviroment.
