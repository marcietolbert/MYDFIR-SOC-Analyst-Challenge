The MYDIFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, created by Steven of the YouTube channel MyDFIR (https://www.youtube.com/@MyDFIR) is a 30-day challenge. The goal of this writeup is to showcase the pracital knowledge and experience I've obtained over the course of the challenge and how it was applied within a simulated SOC enviroment.

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.
