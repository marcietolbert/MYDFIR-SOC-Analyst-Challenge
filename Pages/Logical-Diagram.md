# Logical Diagram

## Introduction
In the MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, day one required me to create a logical diagram for the project. I was eager to tackle this task as I understood the importance of being able to create logical diagrams. In the passages that follow, I will explain the technical aspects of creating both a static and animated diagram. First, however, let's delve into the theory of network diagrams.

## What is a Logical Diagram
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
