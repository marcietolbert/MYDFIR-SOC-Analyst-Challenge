# Logical Diagram

## Introduction
In the MYDFIR SOC Analyst Challenge, day one required me to create a logical diagram for the project. I was eager to tackle this task as I understood the importance of being able to create logical diagrams. In the passages that follow, I will explain the technical aspects of creating both a static and animated diagram. First, however, let's delve into the theory of network diagrams.

## What is a Logical Diagram
So, just what is a logical diagram? First, I'll start by defining what a network diagram is. A network diagram is a visual representation of a computer or telecommunications network that uses icons and lines to depict the devices within an environment and how they are connected. Network diagrams can fall into two categories: physical and logical. A physical diagram illustrates the physical components and connections within a network. In a physical diagram, icons represent the different devices in the environment, while the lines show the cable connections between the devices. 

In contrast, a logical network diagram shows how devices communicate with each other. Similar to a physical diagram, a logical diagram depicts various devices within an environment. However, instead of the lines representing physical cabling, the lines represent data flow. Therefore, I need to create a network diagram that depicts both the devices within the environment and how data flows between them.

Here are some of the most common types of symbols that can be found in a logical diagram.

## Logical Diagram Requirements
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
